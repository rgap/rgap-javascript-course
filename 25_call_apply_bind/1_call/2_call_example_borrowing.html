    <title>Call Example: Borrowing Methods</title>
    <script>
      /**
       * Borrowing Methods Using call
       *
       * Functions in JavaScript can be borrowed from one object and used on another.
       * This is achieved by using call() to set the `this` context dynamically.
       *
       * In this example, we have an object `obj1` with a method `increment`
       * that increases a value. We then borrow this method and apply it to `obj2`
       * which doesn't originally have the method.
       *
       * Why Borrow Methods?
       * - Avoid duplication: reuse functionality across multiple objects.
       * - Enable dynamic method invocation on different contexts.

      // Define obj1 with a property and an increment method
      const obj1 = {
        value: 10,
        increment: function (num) {
          this.value += num;
        },
      };

      // Define obj2 with a different initial value and no increment method
      const obj2 = { value: 20 };

      // Borrow the increment method from obj1 and use it on obj2 using call()
      obj1.increment.call(obj2, 5);
      console.log("After increment, obj2.value:", obj2.value); // Expected Output: 25
