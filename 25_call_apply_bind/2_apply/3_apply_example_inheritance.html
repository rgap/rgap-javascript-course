      /**
       * Constructor Inheritance Using apply
       *
       * Before ES6 classes, one common way to implement inheritance in JavaScript was
       * to call a parent constructor from within a child constructor using apply().
       *
       * In this example:
       * - The Parent constructor initializes properties for a name and a hobby.
       * - The Child constructor calls Parent.apply(this, [name, hobby]) to inherit these properties.
       * - The Child constructor then adds its own property, age.
       *
       * This approach allows the Child instance to be initialized with properties defined
       * in the Parent constructor.
       *
       * How apply differs from call in this context:
       * - With call(), you would invoke the Parent constructor like this:
       *       Parent.call(this, name, hobby);
       *   Here, the arguments (name and hobby) are passed individually.
       *
       * - With apply(), the arguments are passed as a single array:
       *       Parent.apply(this, [name, hobby]);
       *   This can be particularly useful when the arguments are dynamic or already stored in an array.
       *
       * Both methods achieve the same result of setting the Parent's properties on the Child instance,
       * but apply() offers more flexibility in scenarios where argument handling is dynamic.

      // Define the Parent constructor function.
      function Parent(name, hobby) {
        this.name = name;
        this.hobby = hobby;
      }

      // Define the Child constructor function.
      function Child(name, hobby, age) {
        // Use apply to call Parent with Child's context and pass arguments as an array.
        Parent.apply(this, [name, hobby]);
        this.age = age;
      }

      // Create a Child instance.
      const childInstance = new Child("Charlie", "painting", 10);
      console.log("Child instance using apply for inheritance:", childInstance);
      // Expected Output: { name: "Charlie", hobby: "painting", age: 10 }
