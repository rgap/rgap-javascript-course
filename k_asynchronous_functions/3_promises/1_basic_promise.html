      // Basic Promise Example in JavaScript

      // A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

      // Simulate an asynchronous operation like fetching data from an API
      function fetchData() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          // Simulate a delay for the asynchronous operation (e.g., network request)
          setTimeout(() => {
            const success = true; // Change to false to simulate failure

            if (success) {
              const data = { id: 1, name: "John Doe", age: 30 };
              resolve(data); // Resolve the promise with the fetched data
            } else {
              reject("Failed to fetch data."); // Reject the promise with an error message
            }
          }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
        });
      }

      fetchData()
        .then(data => {
          console.log("Data fetched successfully:", data); // Handle the success
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error("Error:", error); // Handle the error
        });

      // Explanation:
      // - This code demonstrates the creation and usage of a promise in a more realistic case of fetching data from an API.
      // - The `fetchData` function simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout to mimic a network request delay.
      // - The promise inside `fetchData` either resolves with fetched data or rejects with an error message based on the value of `success`.
      // - The `then` method is used to handle the resolved value (successful data fetch), and the `catch` method is used to handle the rejected value (failed data fetch).

      // Benefits of Promises:
      // - Avoids callback hell by allowing chaining of asynchronous operations.
      // - Provides a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations and their results.

      // Drawbacks of Promises:
      // - May still lead to promise chains that are hard to read if not managed properly.
      // - Requires understanding of promise behavior and methods (`then`, `catch`, `finally`).

      // Alternatives to Promises:
      // - Async/Await: Built on top of promises, offering a more synchronous-like syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
