      // Promise.all Example in JavaScript

      // Promise.all is a method that takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array resolve.

      const promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000, "First"));
      const promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, "Second"));
      const promise3 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000, "Third"));

      Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
        .then(results => {
          console.log("All promises resolved:", results); // All results are available here
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error("One or more promises failed:", error); // Handle any error that occurred in any of the promises
        });

      // Explanation:
      // - This code demonstrates using `Promise.all` to handle multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.
      // - `Promise.all` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all the promises in the array resolve.
      // - If all promises resolve successfully, the `then` method is called with an array of results.
      // - If any of the promises reject, the `catch` method is called with the error from the first rejected promise.

      // Benefits of Promise.all:
      // - Allows for parallel execution of multiple asynchronous operations.
      // - Provides a single point to handle the completion of all promises.

      // Drawbacks of Promise.all:
      // - If any promise in the array rejects, the entire `Promise.all` call rejects, even if some promises have resolved.
      // - Requires understanding of promise behavior and methods.

      // Alternatives to Promise.all:
      // - Async/Await: Can be used with `Promise.all` for more readable and maintainable code when handling multiple asynchronous operations.
