# Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

## Introduction

The [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is one of the most popular style guides for JavaScript. It provides detailed guidelines on:

- **Naming Conventions:** Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.
- **Code Layout:** Consistent use of blank lines and spaces, proper placement of imports, and clear function definitions.
- **Indentation:** Recommended 2 spaces per indentation level.
- **Whitespaces:** Proper spacing around operators, commas, and within code blocks.
- **Additional Recommendations:** Best practices for Boolean comparisons, null checks, and string methods.

## Why Use the Airbnb Style Guide?

- **Consistency:** It ensures all code follows the same conventions, which improves readability and maintainability.
- **Community Adoption:** Widely used in many projects and companies.
- **Tooling Support:** ESLint configurations and other tools often have presets for Airbnbâ€™s rules.

## Key Sections

1. **Naming Conventions:**

   - Variables and functions should be named using camelCase.

   - Constants (true constants) are often written in UPPERCASE with underscores.

2. **Code Layout:**

   - Use blank lines to separate top-level functions and logical sections.
   - Place imports at the top of the file.

3. **Indentation:**
