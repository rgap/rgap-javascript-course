    <title>External CSS and JS Example</title>
    <!-- 
    External CSS files should be included in the <head> section.

    BENEFITS:
      - Styles are loaded and applied as the HTML is parsed.
      - Prevents a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and provides a better user experience.

    DRAWBACKS:
      - CSS files can block rendering if they are very large, but typically they are optimized for quick loading.
