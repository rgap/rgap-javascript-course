    <title>Script in Head Example</title>
    <script>
      // THEORY:
      // When a script is placed in the <head>, the browser executes it immediately when it encounters it.
      // At this point, the browser may not have parsed the rest of the HTML, particularly the <body> section.
      // As a result, any DOM elements defined later (in the body) are not yet available.
      // This is why trying to access them will often return null.

      // BENEFITS:
      // - Scripts in the head can be used for early initialization (e.g., setting up configurations or polyfills).
      // - Useful if your script needs to be available immediately for other scripts or for certain browser settings.

      // DRAWBACKS:
      // - Since the DOM elements in the body are not yet loaded, accessing them will return null.
      // - It can block rendering, causing a delay in displaying page content.

      // Attempting to access a DOM element with the ID "myElement"
      var element = document.getElementById("myElement");
      // Since the <body> hasn't been loaded yet, "element" will likely be null.
      console.log("Element from head:", element); // Expected output: null
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This element is defined in the <body> and isn't available at the time the script runs -->
    <div id="myElement">Hello from the DOM!</div>
  </body>
</html>
