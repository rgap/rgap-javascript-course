      // In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity that can contain properties (data) and methods (functions).
      // It is used to represent a real-world entity, such as a person, car, or book.

      // An object literal is a way to create an object by directly defining its properties and values
      // within a pair of curly braces {}. This syntax is often used because of its simplicity and clarity.

      // Define an object using an object literal
      let person = {
        // 'name' is a property of the object with a string value "John"
        name: "John",
        // 'age' is another property with a numeric value 30
        age: 30,
      };

      // Access and print the object's properties
      console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 } - prints the entire object
      console.log(person.name); // Output: John - accesses the 'name' property
      console.log(person.age); // Output: 30 - accesses the 'age' property
