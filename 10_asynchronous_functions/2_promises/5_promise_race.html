      // Promise.race Example in JavaScript

      // Promise.race is a method that takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects.

      const promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000, "First"));
      const promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, "Second"));
      const promise3 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000, "Third"));

      Promise.race([promise1, promise2, promise3])
        .then(result => {
          console.log("First promise resolved:", result); // The first result that resolved
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error("First promise rejected:", error); // The first error that occurred
        });

      // Explanation:
      // - This code demonstrates using `Promise.race` to handle multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and respond to the first one that resolves or rejects.
      // - `Promise.race` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise in the array resolves or rejects.
      // - The `then` method is called with the result of the first resolved promise, and the `catch` method is called with the error of the first rejected promise.

      // Benefits of Promise.race:
      // - Allows for handling the first result or error among multiple asynchronous operations.
      // - Useful in scenarios where the fastest response is required, such as timeout handling or selecting the quickest API response.

      // Drawbacks of Promise.race:
      // - If multiple promises are expected to complete, only the first one to resolve or reject is handled.
      // - Requires understanding of promise behavior and methods.

      // Alternatives to Promise.race:
      // - Async/Await: Can be used with `Promise.race` for more readable and maintainable code when handling multiple asynchronous operations.
