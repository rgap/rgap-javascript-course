        Theory: Class Inheritance in JavaScript
        ---------------------------------------
        - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
        - It allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class).
        - The `extends` keyword is used in JavaScript to establish this relationship.

        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }

        /*
          A method in the parent class:
          - This method is shared across all instances of `Animal` and its subclasses.
          - If a subclass does not override it, the subclass will inherit this method.
