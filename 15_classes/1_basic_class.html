      /*
        Theory: JavaScript Classes
        --------------------------
        - JavaScript introduced classes in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to provide a more structured way 
          of working with objects and prototypes.
        - Classes are essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s prototypal inheritance.
        - Unlike traditional class-based languages like Java or C++, JavaScript classes are
          special types of functions.
        - Classes improve code readability, maintainability, and make object-oriented programming (OOP) in JS easier.
      */

      class Person {
        /*
          The constructor method:
          - This is a special method that runs when an instance (object) of the class is created.
          - It is used to initialize properties (variables that belong to the instance).
          - Each instance of the class will have its own copy of these properties.
        */
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name; // `this` refers to the instance being created
          this.age = age;
        }

        /*
          Defining a method inside the class:
          - A method is a function associated with an object.
          - Methods in a class are automatically to the instances.
          - This means that all instances share the same method, improving memory efficiency.
        */
        greet() {
          return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
        }
      }

      /*
        Creating an instance of the class:
        - The `new` keyword is used to create a new object from the class.
        - When `new Person("John", 30)` is executed, the constructor is called, 
          setting `name = "John"` and `age = 30` for this specific instance.
      */
      const person = new Person("John", 30);

      /*
        Calling the greet method:
        - Methods are accessed using dot notation (`object.method()`).
        - `person.greet()` calls the `greet` method for the `person` object.
      */
      console.log(person.greet());

      /*
        Summary:
        - The `Person` class encapsulates data (`name`, `age`) and behavior (`greet`).
        - It provides a reusable blueprint for creating multiple `Person` objects.
        - The class-based syntax is a more structured and readable way of handling objects.
