    <title>Script at End Example</title>
    <!-- 
       THEORY:
       Placing the script at the end of the <body> means that all the HTML elements are loaded and parsed
       before the script runs. This ensures that any DOM elements the script accesses are already present.
       This method is commonly used to avoid issues with undefined or null elements.
    
       BENEFITS:
       - Guarantees that the DOM is fully loaded, so accessing elements works correctly.
       - Improves page load performance as the HTML content is rendered first.
    
       DRAWBACKS:
       - If your script is needed to set up initial page configurations or manage early interactions,
         delaying its execution might not be desirable.

      ** For most casesâ€”especially when your script interacts with DOM elements,
      placing it at the end of the body is the preferred approach **
    -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The DOM element is defined and will be available when the script runs -->
    <div id="myElement">Hello from the DOM!</div>

    <!-- Script is placed at the end of the body -->
    <script>
      // Now that the entire HTML has been parsed, we can safely access the element.
      var element = document.getElementById("myElement");
      // We access the element's innerHTML to verify its content.
      console.log("Element from end:", element.innerHTML); // Expected output: "Hello from the DOM!"
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
