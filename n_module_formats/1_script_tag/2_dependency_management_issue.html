    <title>Dependency Management Issue</title>
    <!-- Incorrect order: script2.js depends on script1.js, but is included first -->
    <script src="script2.js"></script>
    <script src="script1.js"></script>

    <h1>Dependency Management Issue</h1>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
Explanation:
- This HTML file demonstrates the issue of dependency management when using <script> tags.
- script2.js is included before script1.js, even though script2.js depends on the function defined in script1.js.
- This will result in an error because the greet function will not be defined when script2.js tries to use it.
- Proper dependency management is difficult to achieve with <script> tags, especially as the number of scripts grows.
