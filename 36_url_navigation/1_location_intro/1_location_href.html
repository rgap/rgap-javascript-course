       * 📚 Theory:
       * `window.location` is a built-in object in JavaScript that gives you access
       * to the browser's current URL and allows you to redirect or reload pages.
       *
       * `.href` is the full URL (string) of the current page.
       *
       * This is the simplest way to read the full URL from JavaScript.
