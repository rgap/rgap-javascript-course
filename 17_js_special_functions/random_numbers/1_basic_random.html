        Theory: Basic Random Number Generation
        --------------------------------------
        - `Math.random()` generates a pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        - The result is a floating-point number in the range **[0, 1)**.
        - This function is useful as a base for generating numbers in different ranges.
      */

      // Generate a random number between 0 and 1
      const randomNumber = Math.random();
      console.log("Random number between 0 and 1:", randomNumber);
      // Example Output: Random number between 0 and 1: 0.57283947 (varies every time)
