      /*
      Explanation:
      - This file demonstrates method overriding and the use of `super` calls in JavaScript classes.
      - The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and overrides the `speak` method.
      - The `super` keyword is used to call the `speak` method of the parent `Animal` class.
      - An instance of `Dog` is created and the overridden `speak` method is called.
