      /*
      Explanation:
      - This file demonstrates the use of mixins to add reusable functionalities to classes.
      - The `CanFly` mixin adds a `fly` method to any class it is applied to.
      - The `Bird` class extends `Animal` and includes the `CanFly` mixin.
      - The `fly` method is called on an instance of `Bird`, demonstrating the mixed-in functionality.
