        Theory: Private Fields in JavaScript
        ------------------------------------
        - Private fields allow truly private properties in JavaScript classes.
        - They are declared using the `#` prefix and can only be accessed within the class.
        - Unlike conventionally prefixed properties (`_name`), private fields **cannot** be accessed or modified externally.
        - Private fields improve encapsulation by restricting direct modification from outside the class.
      */

      class Person {
        /*
          Defining Private Fields:
          - `#name` and `#age` are private fields.
          - These cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
        */
        #name;
        #age;

        constructor(name, age) {
          this.#name = name;
          this.#age = age;
        }

        /*
          Public Method `getDetails`:
          - This method allows controlled access to the private fields.
        */
        getDetails() {
          return `Name: ${this.#name}, Age: ${this.#age}`;
        }
      }

      const person = new Person("John", 30);

      /*
        Accessing the private fields indirectly via `getDetails`:
        - Since `#name` and `#age` are private, we use a method to retrieve their values.
      */
      console.log(person.getDetails()); // Output: Name: John, Age: 30

      /*
        Attempting to access a private field directly:
        - `console.log(person.#name);` will cause a syntax error.
        - Private fields are not accessible outside the class.
      */
      // console.log(person.#name); // SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class

      /*
        Accessing the field without the `#` prefix:
        - `console.log(person.name);` will return `undefined` because no public `name` property exists.
        - The private field is not exposed as a regular property.
      */
      console.log(person.name); // Output: undefined
