        Theory: Mixins in JavaScript
        -----------------------------
        - Mixins are a way to **reuse functionality across multiple classes** without using classical inheritance.
        - JavaScript does not support **multiple inheritance**, so mixins allow sharing methods across unrelated classes.
        - A mixin is typically a function that takes a base class and **returns a new class** that extends it.
        - Mixins allow adding **modular behaviors** that can be mixed into multiple classes.
      */

      /*
        Defining a Mixin:
        - `CanFly` is a higher-order function that takes a class (`Base`) as input.
        - It returns a new class that **extends** the given `Base` class.
        - The extended class includes a new method `fly()`, which adds flying behavior.
      */
      const CanFly = Base =>
        class extends Base {
          fly() {
            console.log(`${this.name} is flying!`);
          }
        };

      /*
        Defining a Base Class:
        - The `Animal` class provides a common structure for all animals.
        - It has a constructor that initializes the `name` property.
      */
      class Animal {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      }

      /*
        Creating a Class with the Mixin:
        - The `Bird` class extends `Animal`, inheriting the `name` property.
        - It also applies the `CanFly` mixin, gaining the `fly()` method.
      */
      class Bird extends CanFly(Animal) {}

      /*
        Creating an Instance:
        - A `Bird` instance is created with the name `"Eagle"`.
        - Since `Bird` extends `CanFly(Animal)`, it inherits both `name` from `Animal` and `fly()` from `CanFly`.
      */
      const bird = new Bird("Eagle");

      /*
        Calling the `fly` Method:
        - The `fly()` method is inherited from `CanFly`.
        - It outputs a message indicating that the bird is flying.
      */
      bird.fly(); // Output: Eagle is flying!
