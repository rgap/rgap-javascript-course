        üé® **Canvas API Overview**
        ------------------------------
        - The **Canvas API** allows JavaScript to draw 2D graphics dynamically.
        - Introduced in **HTML5 (2004, WHATWG Draft, later standardized in 2011).**
        - Provides a `canvas` element with a **bitmap-based** drawing surface.
        - Used for **game development, data visualization, animations, and image processing**.

        üìú **History**
        --------------
        - **2004**: First implemented by Apple for Safari (used in Dashboard widgets).
        - **2005**: Mozilla and Opera added support, making it widely adopted.
        - **2009**: The W3C and WHATWG standardized the API as part of HTML5.
        - **2011**: HTML5 became a **W3C Recommendation**, making `<canvas>` an official standard.

        ‚úÖ **Advantages**
        ----------------
        - Lightweight and **highly performant** (works directly with pixels).
        - Allows for **custom animations, image manipulation, and game graphics**.
        - Well-supported in **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
        - No need for plugins (unlike Flash, which Canvas helped replace).

        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**
        ------------------
        - Does not support **built-in interactivity** (must handle events manually).
        - Works with pixels, **not scalable like SVG** (no built-in vector scaling).
        - No built-in scene graph (unlike WebGL or SVG).

        - `fillRect(x, y, width, height)` ‚Üí Draws a filled rectangle.
