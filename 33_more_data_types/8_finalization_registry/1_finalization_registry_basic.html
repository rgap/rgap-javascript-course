       * --------------------------
       * üìú Historical Context
       * --------------------------
       * `FinalizationRegistry` was introduced in **ES2021**.
       *
       * It allows you to register a **cleanup callback** that runs
       * *after* an object is garbage collected.
       *
       * üß† This is useful when working with external resources
       * (like file handles or sockets) tied to JavaScript objects.
       *
       * ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
       * - This feature is **non-deterministic** ‚Äî GC timing is unpredictable.
       * - Meant for very advanced use cases.
       */

      const registry = new FinalizationRegistry(heldValue => {
        console.log(`Object with label "${heldValue}" was garbage collected.`);
      });

      let obj = { name: "temporary" };

      // Register the object with the registry
      registry.register(obj, "temporary object");

      // Now we drop all references to `obj`
      obj = null;

      // üßº Eventually, when GC runs, the registry will log the cleanup message
      // ‚ö†Ô∏è This may not happen immediately or at all in short-lived programs.
